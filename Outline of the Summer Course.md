# Outline of the Summer Course

### Understand the basic problems of data analysis and machine learning

  What is, and why / when we need them

  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
  - Supervised VS unsupervised learning

### General introduction (Probability, Optimization, etc.)

  - Linear regression and Least-squre fitting
  - Nonlinear optimization: Newton's iteration and gradient descent
  - Probability: Bayesian VS Frequentist
  - Simple examples on Naive Bayes and Logistic regression
  - Brief talk on decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM)
  - Programming basic on machine learning package *sklearn* for Python

### Introduction to artificial neural network (ANN)

  - The basic concept and model of artificial neuron and ANN
  - Brief talk on principle of back-propagation
  - Introduction to the stochastic gradient descent algorithm
  - Introduction to
    - Discrete convolution and discrete correlation
    - Convolution layer in ANN
    - Basic architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the intuition behind it
  - Programming basic on Wolfram Language
  - Programming basic on the built-in neural network framework of *Mathematica*
  - Understanding CNN with the MNIST handwritting figure recognition problem
  - Brief talk on advanced topics (RNN, NLP, etc.)

### Final project

Design and train a CNN to rate the quality of inputed Chinese calligraphy. The input should be an image, the output can be a numerical score or a pre-defined class. The needed data for training, validation and testing should be prepared by the one practicing the project.
